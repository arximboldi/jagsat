   A continent is a group of regions. It may contain a unique 'name'
   attribute that gives a referentiable and showable name for
   it. Also, it may contain a 'troops' parameter that indicates the
   number of reinforcements that owning this continent rewards the
   player.

<!--

   A region is a country or a delimited area that the player can
   own. Its click area can be defined by either a circle or a
   polygon. The optional 'name' parameter can be used to give it a
   unique name to reference it in the linkions.

   A circle is defined by a point and a radius. The 'radius' is an
   attribute while the center must be specified using a point.

   A poligon defined by the sequence of points that determine its
   frontier polyline.

<!--

   A point must contain an 'x' and 'y' attribute defining its absolute
   coordinates.

   Use 'link' to link several regions so they can be considered
   nerby countries and units can move between them. Note that all the
   linkions are bi-directional. It contains a sequence of
   nodes. Depending on the value of the 'type' attribute this will
   behave:

   - line: The given nodes are going to be sequentially. For example,
   if the nodes named 'a', 'b', 'c' and 'd' are given, the following
   set of linkions will be created: 'a-b, b-c, c-d'
   
   - circle: Same as line, but the last and first nodes are
   linked. In the previous example, 'a-b, b-c, c-d, d-a' links
   would be created.

   - pairs: The links would be created in pair. In the previous
   example, 'a-b, c-d' links would be created.

   - clique: The given nodes are linked to form a clique or
   complete graph. In the previus example, 'a-b, a-c, a-d, b-c, b-d,
   c-d' would be created.
