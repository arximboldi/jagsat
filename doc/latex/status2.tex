\section{Risks}

In the beginning of the project we identified the following risks.

\begin{itemize}
\item \textit{Availability of the resources. As the team members are working in the team besides other studies and activities, it is very difficult to guarantee the availability of the resources.}

We have kept meetings on a regular basis to keep each other motivated and up to date with the tasks we are doing. This has worked well. We have not experienced that other activities (trips, other courses) have hindered the project in any other way than we expected.
\item \textit{Dependency. This game depends on how the TribeFlame device works. Changes in the device may occur, and might make this project very sensitive.}

The device itself has not been a problem, since we have not yet been in need of testing on the device. Software has proven to be a challenge for the most of us.

\item \textit{Motivation. The team members are not motivated enough and may not finish the project on time.}

No problems with the motivation. Everyone is motivated and eager to get the game working.

\item \textit{Lack of knowledge. The programming language Python, which is new to a few team members, may prove to be more challenging than we thought in the beginning of the project.}

Python has indeed been a challenge for many of the team members. We have had two separate meetings concerning Python to make sure everyone has basic knowledge of the language. Other than problems learning we have had some problems regarding the API sent by the client, these problems include not being able to understand how it works properly as well as some features not providing the functionality that they were meant to do.

\item \textit{Over ambitious. The team may plan a game which is not possible to program within the timeframe of the project.}

We have reviewed our project tasks several times. Today we have a clear view of the game and are confident that we can finish it in time. We have a few functions we can skip if we think we do not have the time to finish the game.

\item \textit{Time table not estimated correctly. The schedule is not realistic and has to be revised during the project.}

We have found some problems with the initial schedule. Some changes have been done according with, what we estimate. our resources at this moment.

\item \textit{Injury, illness or other issues that prevent people from working. If this happens we will have to adjust the schedule and switch roles from back-up to main.}

No such things have occurred.
\end{itemize}

\section{Status report summary}

At this stage where facing problems with the planning that we scheduled from the beginning. The lack of experience with Python and both APIs, i.e., TribleFlame and SFML, have become a source of delays and problems. Still, we consider that we are facing the common problems that a big project, as this is, usually have to face. We are still on time and working reviewing the schedule weekly in order to achieve the proper planning for the rest of the project period.
