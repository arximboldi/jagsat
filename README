Code of Greed
=============

Code of Greed is an innovative Risk clone aimed at tablet devices. It
assumes that the tablet PC is laying on a board with the players
sitting around. The user interface rotates to face each of the players
when it is her turn.  Also, it includes customizable maps, and rule
variations, profiles, saving and loading the game and more.
